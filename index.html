			<strong>What can I do as a member of thePinkPanel, and will I be rewarded?</strong>
			As a member, you&rsquo;ll receive emails and Facebook posts alerting you to opportunities to test exciting new products for one day, or sometimes for up to six weeks. After you try and test a product in one of our studies, you will get to keep the product AND receive a $25 - $100+ incentive in gift cards or beauty productsâ€”just for testing them! How great is that?
			<hr />
			But that&rsquo;s not all! You&rsquo;ll also have the opportunity to share your opinions about beauty brands, cosmetics packaging, the latest beauty and personal care devices and tools, and more through survey links that we&rsquo;ll send to you via email or post on Facebook. Share your opinion in the survey and you&rsquo;ll have another chance to win products, prizes and gift cards! We also have fun contests from time to time where you can win cash or gift cards!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>How often do these opportunities come up?</strong>
			Sometimes it can be as many as 1-3 or more opportunities each week. But you never know! Keep an eye out for opportunities at all times! And when you see an opportunity, make sure to act fast!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>How often can I participate in a beauty product test or a beauty survey?</strong>
			We ask that you limit your participation to one beauty product test every six months. That way, more women get a chance to test products! However, you are highly encouraged to participate in as many beauty surveys as you are able.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>I&rsquo;ve been a member for a while and I still haven&rsquo;t been chosen for a panel. What am I doing wrong?</strong>
			You&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong! Sometimes a beauty brand will come to us asking for the opinions of women between a certain age range, or women who only live in certain locations, or women with specific skin issues, for example. Sometimes the beauty product tests are open to any woman. Just keep trying!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>I filled out the survey for a beauty or personal care product test. How do I know if I&rsquo;m chosen to participate?</strong>
			After PinkPanelists have successfully filled out the screener survey for a product test, we randomly choose a limited number of panelists who meet the brand's criteria. We then notify panelists via email if they've been chosen, generally within 3 days of the announcement of the new testing opportunity. If you haven't heard in 3 days, you were not selected for this particular test at this time.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>I was part of a beauty product test and the product(s) that I tested didn&rsquo;t have a brand name on it, or it was concealed. Can I find out the brand name now that the test is done?</strong>
			This is a tricky one! The answer is....sometimes! Some brands are fine with having their brand name revealed, and some brands allow you to test the products with the brand name right on it. Some brands, however, don't wish to reveal the brand name because the formulation of the product is still being refined, or because they have a major product launch planned where they would rather reveal it. Don't take it personally if you cannot find out the brand name of the product you used, but know that by testing it you had a hand in making that product even better!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>I was part of a product test. When do I get my promised incentive?</strong>
			Incentives are generally mailed within 7 days after the end of a test. Shipping times may vary.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Can I share thePinkPanel link with my friends, share it on Facebook, or on a blog?</strong>
			Yes, absolutely! thePinkPanel is open to all women!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Who runs thePinkPanel?</strong>
			thePinkPanel is run by <a href="http://benchmarkingcompany.com/">The Benchmarking Company</a>, a womanowned bi-coastal beauty and personal care consumer research firm.
